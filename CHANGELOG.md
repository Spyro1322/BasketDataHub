# ChangeLog

## FirstSteps

### 2020-10-27
* Git_Configuration 

* ChangeLog_Added

* Papers, web_surfing, studying : Pandas, Seaborn libraries

* FileConfiguration to start visualizing our players' data

* Chose players.csv from NBA games dataset to start with, added in our hub 

### 2020-10-29
* Begin with coding BasicSteps.py : starting from the exclusion of the necessary columns

* Study Antetokoumpo's stats throughout his carreer, plot with his points(not so distinct). I must fix the x-axis too! 

* Spent hours to limitate the data only for the previous season(still to be done) 

* Next, must seperate his stats for each season so as to study his improvement, maybe get dates of games from other csv and group them. 

### 2020-10-30
* Delete missing values from games_details.csv

* Plot different averages of Giannis's stats since his beginning

* It was difficult to choose games per season only by GAME_ID, better add date from different csv too. Got the dataframe(season_df) for all games of the past season.

* Thinking about making a function that given a player's name will produce stats-table for 2019-2020 season.
