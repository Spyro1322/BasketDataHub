# ChangeLog

## FirstSteps

### 2020-10-27
* Git_Configuration 

* ChangeLog_Added

* Papers, web_surfing, studying : Pandas, Seaborn libraries

* FileConfiguration to start visualizing our players' data

* Chose players.csv from NBA games dataset to start with, added in our hub 

### 2020-10-29
* Begin with coding BasicSteps.py : starting from the exclusion of the necessary columns

* Study Antetokoumpo's stats throughout his carreer, plot with his points(not so distinct). I must fix the x-axis too! 

* Spent hours to limitate the data only for the previous season(still to be done) 

* Next, must seperate his stats for each season so as to study his improvement, maybe get dates of games from other csv and group them. 

### 2020-10-30
* Delete missing values from games_details.csv

* Plot different averages of Giannis's stats since his beginning

* It was difficult to choose games per season only by GAME_ID, better add date from different csv too. Got the dataframe(season_df) for all games of the past season.

* Thinking about making a function that given a player's name will produce stats-table for 2019-2020 season.

### 2020-10-31
* Difficulties in choosing only last season's stats. It occured to me that it would be simpler to figure out some total statistics from the entire dataset. For example, top scorers etc.

* Started implementing function for csv's missing values and overview. Saved plots with missing-values freqeuncy per category.  

* We began plotting "easy" graphs for the players. These will be saved for future use. 

* After many tests I managed to design a good plot for top_scorers,passers,rebounders. Checked some of Giannis's stats.

### 2020-11-01
* Tried to change what I was recommended about my plots. I want to add a general, simpler "template" for plotting, let's call it blindplot(hopefully reusable!).

* Begin 2nd week with fresh ideas!
