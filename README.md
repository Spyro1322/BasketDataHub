# BasketDataHub Project

## Description
* Basketball is one of the most popular sports worldwide. The many matches that take place every day all over the world 
make it easy enough for us to find a variety of data and statistics about teams and players(final scores, field_goal percentage etc.).
In this project our primary goals are: finding of datasets with NBA matches, analyzation, visualization of the most important data
and finally, by using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques, results, player awards predictions and comparison of
the final results among the different methods used.
