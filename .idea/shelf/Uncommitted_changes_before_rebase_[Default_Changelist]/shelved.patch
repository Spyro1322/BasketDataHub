<+># ChangeLog\r\n\r\n## FirstSteps\r\n\r\n### 2020-10-27\r\n* Git_Configuration \r\n\r\n* ChangeLog_Added\r\n\r\n* Papers, web_surfing, studying : Pandas, Seaborn libraries\r\n\r\n* FileConfiguration to start visualizing our players' data\r\n\r\n* Chose players.csv from NBA games dataset to start with, added in our hub \r\n\r\n### 2020-10-29\r\n* Begin with coding BasicSteps.py : starting from the exclusion of the necessary columns\r\n\r\n* Study Antetokoumpo's stats throughout his carreer, plot with his points(not so distinct). I must fix the x-axis too! \r\n\r\n* Spent hours to limitate the data only for the previous season(still to be done) \r\n\r\n* Next, must seperate his stats for each season so as to study his improvement, maybe get dates of games from other csv and group them. \r\n\r\n### 2020-10-30\r\n* Delete missing values from games_details.csv\r\n\r\n* Plot different averages of Giannis's stats since his beginning\r\n\r\n* It was difficult to choose games per season only by GAME_ID, better add date from different csv too. Got the dataframe(season_df) for all games of the past season.\r\n\r\n* Thinking about making a function that given a player's name will produce stats-table for 2019-2020 season.\r\n\r\n### 2020-10-31\r\n* Difficulties in choosing only last season's stats. It occured to me that it would be simpler to figure out some total statistics from the entire dataset. For example, top scorers etc.\r\n\r\n* Started implementing function for csv's missing values and overview. Saved plots with missing-values freqeuncy per category.  \r\n\r\n* We began plotting \"easy\" graphs for the players. These will be saved for future use. \r\n\r\n* After many tests I managed to design a good plot for top_scorers,passers,rebounders. Checked some of Giannis's stats.\r\n\r\n### 2020-11-01\r\n* Tried to change what I was recommended about my plots. I want to add a general, simpler \"template\" for plotting, let's call it blindplot(hopefully reusable!).\r\n\r\n* Begin 2nd week with fresh ideas!\r\n\r\n### 2020-11-02\r\n* Studied some things about radar plot to check if it is good for our dataset. Tested some graphs and saved them for possible future use. \r\nWe saw that Lebron James was the most dominant player since 2004. So, I decided to make some more comparisons based on his stats. \r\nLater, we could do same things with different players each time.\r\n\r\n* Compared stats between 2 players too. \r\n\r\n### 2020-11-03\r\n* More studying, less coding. Searched for new ideas to implement(to start as of tomorrow). I have read some things about \r\npredicting models(with naive, MLP, linear regression), most of them are from the papers in our drive. Maybe try starting something with our data. \r\n\r\n* Added some more lines in BasicSteps.\r\n\r\n### 2020-11-05\r\n* Some more visulizations. Added teams.csv in data directory.  \r\n\r\n### 2020-11-12\r\n* After some help managed to solve a few problems regarding our project IDE. Got ready to start writing some code again. \r\n\r\n* Added a requirements.txt and write a short description of our project in the README.md . Tried to delete some warnings.\r\nTomorrow I am going to split BasicSteps in more files so as to make it easier processing my plots. \r\n\r\n### 2020-11-16\r\n* After I split my BasicSteps.py, I decided to add some more files so as to visualize team stats as well(points,assists,\r\nrebounds etc.).\r\n\r\n* It would be interesting to check relationships and correlations between statistical categories and how these relationships\r\nhave effect on teams' wins and overall performance(to be done!!!).\r\n\r\n### 2020-11-19\r\n* I have spent the last couple of days studying some ideas about making my visualizations more dynamic. That means I am \r\ntrying to create functions which will take some arguments and plot the data we ask them to. I have found some difficulties\r\nbut the goal is to make these work until next Friday.\r\n\r\n* Furthermore, I intend to complete my code about the data correlations and statistics' relationships that I mentioned\r\nthe day before.\r\n\r\n### 2020-11-20\r\n* Correlation, distribution, scatter and density plots for the games_details.csv . Reusable functions that can be applied \r\nto each dataset we have.\r\n\r\n### 2020-11-23\r\n* Some more correlations among game statistics. \r\n\r\n* Started transforming our existing files with a more 'functional' look.\r\n\r\n### 2020-11-24\r\n* Spent some time preparing for my upcoming brief presentation about my project. Collected the plots I want to use and \r\norganised my flow.\r\n\r\n* Presentation is ready! Drum roll until Friday.\r\n\r\n### 2020-11-26\r\n* Made some small changes in my files(comments, unnecessary lines of code deleted).\r\n\r\n* I am pleased with most of my work so far. I have been trying to modify team_stats.py but ran into some issues. The results\r\nwill be the same even if I decide to change the structure a bit. The other files both get the job done and look good.\r\n  \r\n### 2020-12-06\r\n* Improved the general look of our code files(more organised, \"cleaned up\").\r\n\r\n* Created a separate file 'utilities.py' for my reusable functions which are going to be called many more times.  \r\n\r\n### 2020-12-09\r\n* The main concern is to improve team_stats.py as I was asked. It is going to be easier to find stats for any team given\r\nteam abbreviation at first and then maybe based on the season we wish. This task is the most important until next week.\r\n\r\n### 2020-12-10\r\n* Made a separate file for correlations between categories. Updated the utilities.py with a few new functions too. \r\nExperimentation on team_stats.py .\r\n  \r\n### 2020-12-11\r\n* Worked on my brief presentation that is coming next week (structure and flow). \r\n\r\n* Beauty up our code files and improve some lines.\r\n\r\n### 2020-12-13\r\n* Created histograms.py for the main categories of the project. It is about visualizing overall team statistics.\r\nCorrelations too(sort of) but need improvements.\r\n\r\n* Finished my presentation and got ready! \r\n\r\n### 2020-12-22\r\n* Deleted unnecessary comments and lines of code from all our files. Ready to start upgrading the project by inserting key\r\nword arguments and make it more functional and easily operable.\r\n  \r\n### 2021-03-09\r\n* Finally we are back. Let's catch up and study what we have already done and what is to be done.\r\n\r\n* Starting from top20.py our goal is to create suitable functions both to find the players we want and plot the results.\r\n\r\n### 2021-03-10\r\n* Keep changing top20.py so as to plot one specific category for a specific player. \r\n\r\n* Study about Click library. Installed virtualenv and Click. It still remains the configuration of setup file. \r\n\r\n### 2021-03-11\r\n* Starting to learn Click, Vim configuration completed and go on.\r\n\r\n### 2021-03-12\r\n* Tutorials on Click, additional links in our drive folder and beginning of the main structure we want to achieve with \r\nclick library.\r\n  \r\n* Check if boxes.py could be more \"functional\". Made it much smaller.\r\n\r\n### 2021-03-22\r\n* Begin our week with team_stats and stats_comparison programs. Surely there will be necessary changes.\r\n\r\n### 2021-03-29\r\n* Let's go at it! Change stats_comparison.py to make radarplots for any given player comparing his individual statistics\r\nto the rest of the league. We also maintained the comparison between two chosen players.\r\n  \r\n### 2021-04-05 \r\n* Overall check for errors, unnecessary code and comments, structure control.\r\n\r\n### 2021-04-07\r\n* Corr_demo & histograms ready. In histograms file there is a RuntimeWarning that needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\n### 2021-05-18\r\n* Started again with boxes, corr_demo, histograms and used *args in our main functions as have been told. I will also check\r\nthe rest of the files for similar changes.\r\n\r\n* Maybe we could come up with some new ideas about visualizing our dataframes.  \r\n\r\n### 2021-05-19\r\n* Going to change stats_comparison and team_stats main functions so as to use them with more arguments.\r\n\r\n### 2021-05-23\r\n* Stats_comparison and team_stats have been updated, email briefing sent and move on !\r\n\r\n### 2021-05-25\r\n* Have done some studying on Click and keep on so. Made something working in top20 with Click library.\r\n\r\n### 2021-05-28\r\n* Read some additional bibliography about Click and I am ready to implement new things until next update at the end of \r\nthe week.\r\n  \r\n* Added our main functions in the setup.py file of the virtual environment.
